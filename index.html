    <h2>About the Visa</h2>
    <div class="visa-info">
        <p>The South Korean Ministry of Justice has launched a progressive initiative aimed at enhancing the nation's talent pool by facilitating pathways to permanent residency or citizenship. This initiative is particularly beneficial for international students graduating from prestigious institutions in Korea.</p>
        <p>Under this scheme, the <strong>F-2-7S visa</strong> is offered to eligible students and recent alumni from universities such as UST, KAIST, UNIST, DGIST, and GIST. This visa allows for a maximum sojourn period of five years, offering a substantial timeframe for graduates to develop their careers and establish a life in South Korea.</p>
        <p class="cute-note">Did you know? The <strong>F-2-7S visa</strong> first made its appearance in December 2021, marking a significant milestone in South Korea's approach to international education and residency.</p>

                <p>The F-2-7 visa is a general long-term residency visa based on a points system, while the F-2-7S visa is specifically designed for highly talented individuals, often with more stringent requirements and higher expectations for professional achievements and income levels.</p>

            <button class="accordion-button" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">Q: When can I apply for the extension of my visa?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>You can apply for the extension starting from 4 months to 1 month before the expiration date. For example, if it is expiring on February 22, 2025, you can start applying from October 2024.</p>

            <button class="accordion-button" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">Q: How many years of visa will they give us when we apply for the first time?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>The total period of the visa is 5 years, and they will give you a maximum of 2 years each time. Remember, it depends on the expiration date of your passport. If it will expire within one year of your visa application, you will only get one year. So, try to update your passport. But still, you can apply for the extension, but you have to pay the application fee, which you would have avoided if you had gotten two years from the start.</p>
