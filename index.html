    <div class="process-step">

                <span class="notice">* Valid if issued within three months of the visa application. Must be translated and notarized in English if not originally in English.</span>
            </li>
            <li>3 x Recommendation letters (1 from academic advisor, 2 from Korean fellows (KAIST-ian), all written in English)</li>
            <li>1 x List of Key Achievements for President’s Letter of Recommendation (written in English) <br>
                <span class="notice">* Mandatory for applicants from October 1, 2022, onwards.</span>

    <!-- Step 2: Invited to an Interview -->
    <div class="process-step">
        <h3>2. Invited to an Interview</h3>
        <p>Prepare for the interview, demonstrate your enthusiasm for staying and working in Korea, and show how you plan to integrate into Korean society. Be honest and express your long-term goals clearly.</p>

            <p>In the interview or when you write your plans, you should express that you want to work in Korea, not apply for a PhD. If you say you want to pursue a PhD, they might tell you that you don't need an F-2-7 visa for that, and you will be denied. Another reason for denial would be indicating that you only want to work in a foreign company situated in Korea. There was a case where an applicant who wanted to work exclusively in a foreign company in Korea got declined. Make sure to show that you want to work in a Korean company.</p>

    <!-- Step 3: President’s Recommendation Letter Issuance Process -->
    <div class="process-step">
        <h3>3. President’s Recommendation Letter Issuance Process</h3>
        <p>Interviews are granted only to those who submit all required documents, including three recommendation letters and an apostilled official criminal record certificate.</p>
        <p>ISSS will contact candidates for interviews individually. Successful candidates will receive the president's letter of recommendation within 2-3 business days after the interview results are announced.</p>
        <p class="important-remark">* Those who do not pass the interview may be given a second chance if they submit a letter of justification within 10 days from the notification date. Second chance interviews are conducted twice a year (January-February, July-August).</p>
        <p class="final-remark">* Those who fail to pass the first interview or the second chance interview and do not receive a president’s recommendation letter should apply for the existing F2-7 (point system) residence visa.</p>
